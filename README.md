 Game Console Case for Framework Motherboard

 This is a "Modern Game Console" case for the Framework Motherboard. 

All joints are designed to be used with M3 heat inserts. The only glue used in this project is to hold the 4 outer panels together once printed. 

The split STEP file is designed to cut the case to fit on standard 220mm 3D Printers 

Once the print has been tested i will upload STL files to print. 

The extra port on the back of the case is designed to allow you to add LED lights inside the case and power with standard 12v power
