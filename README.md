 Game Console Case for Framework Motherboard

 This is a "Modern Game Console" case for the Framework Motherboard. 

All joints are designed to be used with M3 heat inserts. The only glue used in this project is to hold the 4 outer panels together once printed. 

The split STEP file is designed to cut the case to fit on standard 220mm 3D Printers
