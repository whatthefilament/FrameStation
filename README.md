# FrameStation
 This is a "Modern Game Console" case for the Framework Motherboard. 

All joints are designed to be used with M3 heat inserts. The only glue used in this project is to hold the 4 outer panels together once printed. If you would like extra rigidity you can also glue inbetween the inner panels as well

The split STEP file is designed to cut the case to fit on standard 220mm 3D Printers 

To use the expansion cards you simply need 4 short usb c extension cables to run from the motherboard to the front/rear expansion card slots

The extra port on the back of the case is designed to allow you to add LED lights inside the case and power with standard 12v power
